  <mat-step label="Step 1: What's a Signal">
    <div class="step1">
      <p>Let's say we have an app like this one, and we want to set up data so that other places in the code will get notified when their value changes.</p>
      <p>A signal is perfect for this, because it gives us the ability to track a single "reactive" value and automatically notify interested consumers when it changes.</p>
      <p class="code">(() => T)</p>
      <p>In this particular app, we might want to track the <span class="code">users</span> count found at the top-left with the label "All Users".</p>
      <p>At the start of their life, signals can be given an initial value.</p>
      <p class="code">users = signal(159845);</p>
      <p>This will then be tracked and send a "signal" to different parts of our code with succeeding updates to the value.</p>
      <p>Signals are zero-argument functions. When executed, they return the current value of the signal.</p>
    </div>
  </mat-step>
    
  <mat-step label="Step 2: Settable Signals">
    <div class="step2">
      <p>Let's say you want to update our users, we know that as of our last update, we now have 160000. We can set that amount.</p>
      <p class="code">users = signal(159845);<br>
      <br>
      users.set(160000);</p>
      <p>We can also update the users as new users come on to the platform.</p>
      <p class="code">users.update(user => user + 1);</p>
      <p>We do this via <code>SettableSignal</code>. In addition to being a getter function, we can also change the value of the signal, and notify any dependents of the change. The API includes <code>.set</code> for replacement, <code>.update</code> for deriving a new value, and <code>.mutate</code> for performing internal mutation of the value.</p>
    </div>
  </mat-step>
    
  <mat-step label="Step 3: What is Computed?">
    <div class="step3">
      <p>There are a few amounts on this page derived from our users. In the key at the bottom, you can see the change between this month and last month.</p>
      <p>We don't necessarily want a whole new value to update manually. Computed values allow us to show a derived value, a new view from our data in our signal.</p>
      <p class="code">// Automatically updates when `users` changes:<br>
        const thisMonth = computed(() => users() - lastMonth);</p>
      <p>Computed values are cached based on their dependencies and will only update when necessary.</p>
      <p>Any signals read by that calculation will be tracked as dependencies, and the value recalculated when any these dependencies change.</p>
    </div>
  </mat-step>

  <mat-step label="Step 4: Effect!">
    <div class="step4">
      <p>There are times when we might want something to occur when a signal has a new value.</p>
      <p>With <code>effect()</code>, we can schedule and run a side-effectful function inside a reactive context.</p>
      <p>Let's say we want to redraw the connecting lines when a user amount changes, in case the lines are adjusting.</p>
      <p class="code">
        users.set(180000);<br>
        effect(() => redrawLines());
      </p>
    </div>
  </mat-step>

  <mat-step label="Step 5: What else?">
    <div class="step5">
      <p class="emphasis">This is just the beginning! ðŸŽ‰</p>
      <p>Angular Signals also has:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flexible effect scheduling, allowing for seamless integration with Angular, and other adjacent libraries like RxJS</li>
        <li>Leaning into the compiler to optimize various reactive operations, especially DOM APIs and updates</li>
        <li>Lazy evaluation, so that the user doesn't have to explicitly batch operations</li>
      </ul>
